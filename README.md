# TriviaGame
I created a dog-themed trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

## How it works
* A trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
* If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will move to the next question with no user input at all.
* The scenario is similar for incorrect answers and time-outs.
    * If the player chooses the wrong answer, it tells the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then display the next question.
    * If the player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then display the next question.
* On the final screen, show the number of correct answer, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

## Technology and concept used
* JavaScript Timer
* jQuery
* CSS Bootstrap
